# Prior art: rivals, past winners, shipped products

This feeds idea-forge's novelty and white-space pass. The judges ask: "Were the APIs used in ways
nobody expected? Does this already exist five times over?" (Creativity & originality, 25%). Fetched
2026-10-05.

Rows marked ✓ were verified by the lead via `gh repo view` (exists, dates, description) on
2026-10-05. Other rows come from sub-agent capture with the source URL given. One-line
descriptions are the lead's wording.

## 0. Read this first: crowding summary (INFERENCE)

- **Saturated for this event:** at least 14 public entries already target it, built 2026-09-16 → 2026-10-05. They cluster on:
  - cross-issuer **gap / fair-price radars**;
  - **best-execution routers** and quote guards;
  - **weekend fair-value** estimation;
  - NL / Telegram trading agents;
  - MCP / skill wrappers.
- **Thin or empty so far (as found):**
  - earnings-calendar positioning;
  - drift-threshold **rebalancing** of a basket (only Portir does DCA);
  - **thematic one-tap baskets on BSC** (baskets exist on Base, Solana, Robinhood Chain and Ondo-ETH, not BSC);
  - card-to-stock onboarding;
  - corporate-action-aware holding (dividend/split handling beyond a "halt" guard);
  - post-trade PnL/tax reporting;
  - agent evaluation / backtesting harnesses.
- **Lead-verified technical traps that rivals' framing often misses** (see the sponsor files):
  - the RWA API `referencePrice` is *derived from* the on-chain price;
  - xStocks have negligible BSC liquidity and no RWA Data coverage;
  - Ondo is RFQ-only and closes outside hours except Off-Hours assets;
  - bStock RFQ closes outside hours while bStock AMM pools don't.

## 5. Market-behavior evidence (for "weekend gap" ideas)

*(sub-agent; secondary. Quote with care.)*

- **Talos, 2026-06-24.** NVDAx weekend volume averaged "41% of its weekday volume" vs 17% for NVDAon. These are Solana/Ethereum figures, not BSC.
- **CoinDesk opinion, 2026-09-24.** The median deviation from NYSE close in market hours was "0.87%", widest "2.71%". An after-hours spike of "$2.55 to $23.16" came from a thin pool. Hedging is "not arbitrage".
- **FXStreet, 2026-10-04.** "47% of bStocks trading happened outside US market hours".
- **Hackernoon, Sep 2026.** Total tokenized stocks about "$3.1 billion". Ondo $947M, xStocks $693M, bStocks $678M. BNB Chain is "roughly $1 billion, a third of the market".
- **Lead's verified snapshot (2026-10-05):**
  - NVDAB/USDT PancakeSwap v3 ≈ $4.38M reserve and $8.25M 24h volume.
  - NVDAon AMM pools idle (RFQ market).
  - NVDAx ≈ $474.
  - In practice, on-chain 24/7 depth on BSC means **bStocks**.

## 6. What judges have said in past editions

*(sub-agent; verbatim where quoted)*

- This event's blog: "Specific and honest beats polite." "Judges need to run it. If they can't, you're scored on the video alone." Tie-break: "depth of W3W API usage first, then the quality of your feedback report." "There's no live PnL scoring."
- BNB AI Hack rules: "Ensure the contract address has at least 2 successful transactions within the hackathon timeframe". Open source "with a reasonable commit history".
- Smart Money Era: "Single-category submissions score poorly. All four, equally deep, is the bar."
- No earlier BNB hackathon required a standalone Developer Experience Report. "Most hackathons don't ask for one." [BLOG]
